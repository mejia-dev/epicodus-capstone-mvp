# Capstone Planning Log

### Thoughts:
* Python has [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) framework.


### Time Log:
* 2024-03-22
  * 8:00am - 
    * Researching gamemaking in Python. 
    * Discovered pygame framework. Researching games built with this framework to see if it seems suitable.
      * Looked through https://www.pygame.org/tags/platformer collection.
      * Noted that several titles seem to be lower production quality. Not sure if this is because pygame is mostly used for hobbyist / gamejam situations or if it's because it's difficult to use.
      * Appears that this is one of the few examples of a production-quality game that has been released: https://cheezye.itch.io/metal-arbiter.
      * Leaning towards JS, but will see if another Python library/framework can be found.
