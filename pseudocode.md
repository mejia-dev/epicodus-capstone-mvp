# Welcome to Pseudocode.md

### The purpose of this document is to write overall functionality for the game in pseudocode so that it can be easily referenced when writing actual code. Each set of code will be broken up by section. JavaScript is assumed.


### MusicAnalyzer
  
  * Objectives:
    - get frames of songs? -- these might not need to be gathered all at once, but it is possible that we will need to establish highs and lows of the song so that code can know what to consider a "high" on a quiet song or a "low" on a loud song (`this.musicMaxHeight` & `this.musicMinHeight`)
    - get bpm / tempo of song (`this.musicTempo`)
    - get length of song (`this.musicLength`)

  ```javascript
