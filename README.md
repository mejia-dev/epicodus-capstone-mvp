# Epicodus Capstone Development Log
This repository is not a project itself, but instead serves as code samples, demonstration, and a project planning log for the Epicodus Capstone. 

### üí° Project Idea:
The goal of this project is to create an autoscrolling platformer with the platforms set to user-uploaded music.

The finished project can be found [here](https://github.com/mejia-dev/rhythmrunner).

### üìù Documentation:
* [Capstone Proposal](./capstone-proposal.md) - The official capstone proposal as outlined in the [Epicodus requirements](https://full-time.learnhowtoprogram.com/capstone/capstone-week-2/capstones---sign-ups-and-proposal).
* [Timetracker](./Timetracker.md) - A time tracker & dev log for the game with detailed notes about progress and the actions taken to make that progress.
* [Pseudocode](pseudocode.md) - Some pseudocode sketched out to help with the overall structure of different components and what they should do.
* [Planning](./Planning.md) - An initial planning log completed during the first 8 hours of Capstone work.

### üìÇ Other Files in this Project:
* Visualizer
  * The `visualizer` folder contains a sample visualizer from the initial stages of development.
* Demos
  * The `demos` folder contains different stages of a demo version of the game used until the MVP was created and development was moved to the [RhythmRunner repository](https://github.com/mejia-dev/rhythmrunner). Launch one of the .html files in a web browser to view.
